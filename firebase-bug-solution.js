The solution involves reviewing and adjusting your Firebase security rules to allow the specific read/write operations attempted in your code. Ensure that the rules correctly identify the user's authentication state and grant appropriate access.   Example (adjust to your needs):

```javascript
db.ref('/').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.val());
});

// Incorrect rules (too restrictive):
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": false,
    ".write": false
  }
}

// Correct rules (allowing read access to authenticated users):
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```
Remember to deploy the updated rules to your Firebase project.
