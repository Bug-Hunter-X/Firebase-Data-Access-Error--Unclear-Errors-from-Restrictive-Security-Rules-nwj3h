This example demonstrates a common yet frustrating Firebase issue: unclear errors caused by overly restrictive security rules. The `firebase-bug.js` file shows code that attempts to write data, failing silently or with a generic error due to incorrectly configured rules. The `firebase-bug-solution.js` file provides the solution, outlining how to properly adjust your Firebase security rules for the intended data access.
